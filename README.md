In today’s digital era, streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, and Sony LIV offer thousands of movies to viewers. While this variety provides flexibility, it also creates the “Paradox of Choice,” where too many options make decision-making difficult and time-consuming, often resulting in users spending more time searching than watching.
To address this problem, modern platforms use Recommendation Systems, which reduce browsing time and improve user satisfaction. With the same objective, our Movie Recommendation System is designed to guide users toward movies that closely match their interests. Unlike basic recommenders that depend only on genre or rating averages, our system uses a hybrid AI-based approach combining multiple machine learning techniques to deliver accurate and personalized suggestions.
What Makes Our System Unique?
1.	Hybrid Recommendation Model:
o	Content-Based
o	Collaborative Filtering
o	Popularity-Based
o	Genre-Boosted Similarity
o	TMDB Visual Enhancement
2.	Minimum 80% Similarity Constraint:
Ensures only closely related movies are suggested.
3.	Poster Integration:
Real movie posters fetched using TMDB API create an OTT-like experience.
4.	Fully Functional Streamlit Front-End:
Provides a dynamic and interactive user interface.
5.	Professional UI Components:
Movie cards, similarity badges, rating stars, genre tags, hover effects, dark theme, and gradients.
6.	Uses Both Textual (TF-IDF) & Behavioral (User Ratings) Data:
Makes recommendations more meaningful and reliable.
In summary, the Movie Recommendation System is not just a basic ML project—it functions as a mini OTT-style recommendation platform demonstrating how real streaming services personalize content using AI.
